# my css lib

Helper for quick layouting projects.
It uses Componant, Modificator and Variables for multy-lvl handling.

Every element is setting with `flex`, `wrap` and `direction-column`. It useful for footer and for adding responsive easily. You juste have to set `display--row` and use other display flex modificators if need to change axis.

For better lisibility on file, every class is prefixed by its category name, like :

```html
<section class="position--relative shape--rounded">
	<header class="padding--m-children">
		<h2 class="text--upper">Section title</h2>
		<p>hello beers</p>
	</header>
</section>
```

## Variables
Add you own values in `_colors` and ` _typeface` with your own visual identity. You can also set size of h-titles and update spacing as you need for comfort layouting.

## Modificators
Use modificators for adding specific style on a element like color, font transform, display, position etc... 
use `children` suffix on any modificator to apply style on every first lvl children of an element.

## Componants
It define structure for different element as lists, gallery, global structure, shape etc... you can add your own in `custom-componant` file, Ã¬f you need specific design.
